## My Passion

### 💡 **I Love Creating**
Since childhood, I’ve enjoyed DIY projects and pursued a degree in Electronic Information Engineering. My drive is to make life more convenient through innovation. I take on multiple roles in projects—**supply chain procurement, industrial design, software & hardware engineering, product management**—and I’m quick to learn whatever is needed to bring ideas to life. ⚙️✨

### 🕵️‍♂️ **Curiosity and Pranks**
Hacking is a mindset. I constantly wonder: *How does this work? Are there vulnerabilities? Can I harmlessly exploit them for fun?* Pranks are my playful way of exploring and testing systems. 🛠️😄

### 📚 **Lifelong Learning**
In my free time, I dive into philosophy, history, biology, physics, cognitive neuroscience, investment, psychology, AI, and computer science. These diverse fields help me see the world from different perspectives and fuel my passion for solving new problems. 🌍🔍

👉 **I thrive on tackling unknown challenges.** 🚀
