## My Passion

### **I Love Creating**
Since childhood, I’ve enjoyed DIY projects, which led me to pursue a degree in Electronic Information Engineering. My goal is to create things that make life more convenient. I take on multiple roles—**supply chain procurement, industrial design, software & hardware engineering, product management**—and I learn quickly to bring ideas to life. 💡

### **I Love Studying How Things Work & Enjoy Pranks**
Hacking is a mindset for me. I'm always curious about how things work, finding vulnerabilities, and figuring out if I can execute harmless pranks. 🤓🔍 It’s my playful way of understanding systems and testing their limits.

### **I Love Reading**
In my spare time, I explore diverse subjects like philosophy, history, biology, physics, cognitive neuroscience, investment, psychology, AI, and computer science. 📚 Each field provides a unique lens to understand the world, helping me tackle problems from multiple perspectives.
