# Hi there, I'm daleewong üëã

## My Passion
I love creating
I have liked to do various DIYs since I was a child, and I applied for electronic information engineering major when I grew up.

For me, making people's life more convenient is my motivation for creation

## I like studying how things works, I like pranks
Hacking is a way of life. I always  think: how it works? Are there any vulnerabilities? Do I have the possibility to implement my harmless pranks on it?

## I like reading
In my spare time, I like to read philosophy, history, biology, physics, cognitive neuroscience, investment, psychology, general artificial intelligence, computer science.

For me, they are all disciplines, just different ways of understanding the world. They allow me to not stick to one perspective when encountering problems, I like to explore the world more.
